# Innovation Strategies
## _Front-End Technical Test_

__You must use the main.ts file, using the foo function__

1. For the first test, we ask you to create an object that contains a name and use a hello function that prints "hello {the person's name}"

2. For the second part of the test, you have to make the above object immutable, and you have to create a test with Jest that validates that the object is immutable

3. For this third part, you have to import the data.json file found in the root of src
    - First you have to create an array of objects with the data obtained in the .json file.
    - Now we must return the number of times the names are repeated with the following structure { name: string; times: number; }.
    - According to the previous structure, it orders from highest to lowest, showing only the first 3, and only returning the name of the person.
    - Create a test that checks all of part 3.

## _Requirements for the test_
  - Only have node installed
